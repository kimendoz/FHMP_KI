    What do we mean by Distributions in this Study?

	<p>
        In the instructions we will refer to a “distribution of outcomes around #”. At a high level, this distribution
        means that the seller does not know the <i><u>exact</u></i> value of the asset to be sold, but knows the most likely outcome.
        Other numbers are possible outcomes, but as you move away from #, the likelihood of these numbers decreases
        (i.e., while possible, they are not as likely to occur as #).
