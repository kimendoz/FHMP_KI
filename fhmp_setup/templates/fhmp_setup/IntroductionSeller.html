	<p>
        In this study there are 4 sellers, 5 buyers, and an automated fact checker. You are a <strong>seller</strong>.
        You will play a seller for 24 rounds (4 practice rounds and 20 actual rounds).
	</p>

    <p>
        Every round, each seller has one asset to sell (this is how the seller earns money). Every round, buyers bid
        on assets and can bid on as many assets as they want (the buyer earns money by winning assets but must pay
        money to cover the cost of their purchases).
