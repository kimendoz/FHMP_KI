        As an example, if you were told that you have a probability distribution around , it would mean:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>There is a 30% chance the asset will be worth 6</li>
        <li>There is a 18% chance the asset will be worth 7</li>
        <li>There is a 18% chance the asset will be worth 5</li>
        <li>There is a 2% chance the asset will be worth any other number from 1 to 20*</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The distribution generally looks like this around #</p>
