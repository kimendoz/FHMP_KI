        First, each seller receives a number # between 1 and 20. This number # represents the most likely value of
        their asset. Only the seller knows the number #; no other person in the study knows the number the seller was
        given. While this number # is the most likely value of the asset, it is not guaranteed to be the actual value
        of their asset. The actual value of their asset is determined by drawing from a distribution of outcomes around
        #. Therefore although # is the most likely outcome, it is possible it will not be the actual value of the asset.
