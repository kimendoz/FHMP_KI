    What do we mean by Distributions in this Study?

	<p>
        The specific likelihoods in our “distribution of outcomes around #” mean the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>There is a 30% chance the asset will be worth #</li>
        <li>There is a 18% chance the asset will be worth # + 1</li>
        <li>There is a 18% chance the asset will be worth # - 1</li>
        <li>There is a 2% chance the asset will be worth any other number from 1 to 20*</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        *Note: Possible values are 1-20, so if # is either 1 or 20, then the last line is "There is a 3% chance the asset will be worth any other number from 1 to 20".
    </p>

    <p>The distribution generally looks like this around #</p>
