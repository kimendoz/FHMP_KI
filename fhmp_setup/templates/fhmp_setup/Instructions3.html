    Instructions: The Fact Checker
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
	<p>
		A fact checker is able to see in which quartile (5 number range) the sellerâ€™s number falls
        (i.e., Q1: 1-5, Q2: 6-10, Q3: 11-15, or Q4: 16-20), but not the exact number. The fact checker compares the
        range the seller discloses to the range they have, and then provides a grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
        about how accurate the range is with A being the most accurate. Because the fact checker only knows a range,
        the grade is based on the midpoint of their range. The fact checker is automated and therefore is accurate.
